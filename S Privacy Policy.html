<p>If you are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory, you are welcome to contact us.</p>

<p>Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by us of third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present Policy and in the Cookie Policy, if available.</p>

<p><a><font size="3"><strong>Methods of processing</strong></font></a></p>

<p>We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.
The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to us, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by us. The updated list of these parties may be requested from us at any time.</p>

<p><a><font size="3"><strong>Legal basis of processing</strong></font></a></p>

<p>We may process Personal Data relating to You if one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations We may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
<li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
<li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which We are subject;</li>
<li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;</li>
<li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, We will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

<p><a><font size="3"><strong>Place</strong></font></a></p>

<p>The Data is processed at our operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.</p>

<p>If any such transfer takes place, You can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

<p><a><font size="3"><strong>Retention time</strong></font></a></p>

<li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of our legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. You may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by us within the relevant sections of this Policy or by contacting us.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, We may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</p>

<p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>
